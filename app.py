    Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points:
    
    It is clear enough that some of Kierkegaard's early writings contained disguised 
    communications to Regine, who soon married another man (Johan Frederik Schlegel, 
    later Governor-General of the Danish West Indies), which meant that Kierkegaard 
    could not communicate directly with her. He hoped she might come to realize that 
    he still loved her, but also understand why he could not go through with the 
    marriage. Biographies of Kierkegaard often focus on the broken engagement in 
    detail, and commentators have sometimes gone to great 
    lengths to find "messages to Regine" in Kierkegaard's texts, some more plausible than others. However, 
    Regine was far from the only person who could be described as "that individual" to whom Kierkegaard 
    dedicated many of his works.

    My Adidas walk through concert doors
    And roam all over coliseum floors
    I stepped on stage, at Live Aid
    All the people gave, and the poor got paid
    And out of speakers I did speak
    I wore my sneakers but I'm not a sneak
    My Adidas touch the sand of a foreign land
    With mic in hand, I cold took command
    My Adidas and me close as can be
    We make a mean team, my Adidas and me
